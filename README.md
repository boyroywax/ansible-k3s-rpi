This Ansible playbook turns your fleet of Raspberry Pi into Kubernetes cattle with k3s, the streamlined version of Kubernetes by @rancher that runs silky smooth on the ARM processor powering your Pi.

# Manually prepare your Raspberries
- Burn Raspian Stretch Lite on an SD card with EtcherBalena, or something alike
- Create an empty `ssh` file in the root of the SD card (volume is called `boot`)

# Secure your Raspberries
Optional but advisable: use SSH key auth and disable password login.
The default ssh credentials for a Raspberry Pi are username `pi` and password `raspberry`.
- Copy your pubkey to the Pi with `ssh-copy-id pi@kube1.example.com`
- In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on the Pi, set `PasswordAuthentication` to `no`

# Configure ansible setup
- Copy `ansible/hosts.template` to `ansible/hosts` for your configuration
- Choose one of the Raspberries to lead / orchestrate your cluster; we'll call this the _server_
- In `ansible/hosts`, fill out the ip or hostname for the leading Raspberry under `[k3s-server]`
- Fill out the ip's or hostnames for the rest of your cattle under `[k3s-agents]`
- Specify `k3s_version` in group_vars/all

I personally prefer using the Pi's hardware mac address to assign a hostname and ip address within the LAN by DHCP, but you could also set a static ip address on the Pi.

# Provision the nodes
When you're all set up and configured, run the Ansible playbook:
```bash
$ make
```

This will:
- Install the k3s binary on the 'server' Pi (the leading node)
- Install a `k3s-server` service on the server and start it
- Fetch the node token from the server
- Install and start a `k3s-agent` service on the agents, joining the cluster
- Enable autostart on boot for k3s on all nodes

# See if it worked
Log into your server node and run:
```bash
$ sudo k3s kubectl get node -o wide
```
You should see all of your nodes broadcasting a _Ready_ status.

Happy cattle herding!


# Build a Kubernetes cluster using k3s via Ansible.

## K3s Ansible Playbook

Build a Kubernetes cluster using Ansible with k3s. The goal is easily install a Kubernetes cluster on machines running:

- [X] Debian 9
- [Â ] Ubuntu 16.04
- [ ] CentOS 7

on processor architecture:

- [X] x64
- [X] arm64
- [X] armhf

## System requirements:

Deployment environment must have Ansible 2.4.0+
Master and nodes must have passwordless SSH access

## Usage

Add the system information gathered above into a file called hosts.ini. For example:

```
[master]
192.16.35.12

[node]
192.16.35.[10:11]

[kube-cluster:children]
master
node
```

Start provisioning of the cluster using the following command:

```
ansible-playbook site.yaml
```
